[**Project**](http://scimind.ai/sciknoweval/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='Hsxmwr0AAAAJ:'></span></strong>
- This paper introduce the SciKnowEval benchmark, a novel framework that systematically evaluates LLMs across five progressive levels of scientific knowledge. Specifically, we take biology and chemistry as the two instances of SciKnowEval and construct a dataset encompassing 50K multi-level scientific problems and solutions.
